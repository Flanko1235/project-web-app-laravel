It consists of a clinically relevant, web-based scheduling and appointment which is accessible to patients for booking, rescheduling, and cancelling appointments. An effective medical record management system, which will secure access and update for patients as well as clinic staff. The website will have a billing and payment system in order to facilitate payment of bills easily, and it will ensure the timely information concerning the operations of clinic, hours of operation, and news. The aim of this project is to optimize clinic work processes as well as decrease waiting times and provide a more structured, reliable health service.
